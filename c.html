          Sundar Pichai’s life journey is an inspiring story of talent, hard work, and determination. Born on June 10, 1972, in Chennai, India, he grew up in a humble household where his father worked as an engineer. Pichai showed exceptional memory and curiosity from a young age, especially in technology. After studying at local schools, he earned a place at IIT Kharagpur, where he completed his degree in metallurgical engineering and was recognized as an outstanding student. He then moved to the United States to pursue higher studies at Stanford University and later completed an MBA from the Wharton School. Pichai joined Google in 2004 and initially worked on the Google Toolbar, but he quickly rose through the company by leading major projects like Google Chrome, Chrome OS, and Android. His strong leadership, calm personality, and ability to innovate helped him become the CEO of Google in 2015. In 2019, he reached another milestone when he became the CEO of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. From a simple upbringing in India to leading one of the world’s biggest technology companies, Sundar Pichai’s journey shows that perseverance and learning can take you to incredible heights.         </p>
